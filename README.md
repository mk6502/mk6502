### Hi ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on big data engineering with Spark+Python on AWS over at Nielsen.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about k8s in the small amount of time that I'm not working on my Master's in CS.
- ðŸ¤” I could use help with understanding DeFi and applications on blockchains. No buzzwords, no nonsense - what's real and what's not?
- ðŸŒŽ I occasionally write blog posts at https://mikestaszel.com/.

### Management, Being a Tech Lead, and Software Engineering
I consider myself to be a software engineer at heart. The software I write tends to be backend and data-intensive.
Nowadays I'm trying to do less code-writing and more of everything else:

* Writing READMEs (like this one)
* Writing blog posts (sure)
* Reading (yes, actual books)
* Thinking about design patterns and architecture
* Mentoring and leading a team building products

### Everything Else
In my spare time nowdays I chip away at a Master's Degree (OMSCS), one course at a time. I'm more than halfway done, there's no turning back now.
My wife and I enjoy hiking, biking, traveling, and playing with our Shih Tzu.
