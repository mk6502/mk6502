### Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, I'm Mike.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on big data engineering with Spark on k8s on AWS at [iSpot.tv](https://www.ispot.tv/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m focusing on mentoring and coaching my team to improve their skills and release awesome products.
- ðŸ“š I love to read - check out my list of books to see what I'm reading.
- ðŸŒŽ I occasionally write blog posts about software engineering topics.

### Management and Software Engineering
I consider myself to be a software engineer at heart. Nowadays I'm trying to do less code-writing and more of everything else:

* Reading and learning.
* Writing, writing, and more writing.
* Thinking about design patterns and architecture (how do you scale k8s _really_)
* Mentoring and leading a team building products and shipping features
* Hiring (!)

### Stuff I've Worked On
* Django! My first internship and full-time job was at a startup that was built on top of Django.
* Built an Android app for fun. It was much easier than multiple failed attempts of creating an iOS app.
* Machine Learning. Just scratched the surface. Data cleansing and feature engineering really is 95% of the job.
* Built a CHIP-8 emulator. It plays Pong and that's pretty much it. Maybe I'll work on a Gameboy emulator next.
* Spark, Hadoop, Hive. My second job was doing that on Azure. My last job was doing that on-prem, then we migrated to AWS EMR. Now we're running Spark on k8s. Also AWS EC2, EMR, ECS, EKS, Lambda, API Gateway, CodePipeline, VPC, IAM, CloudFormation, and plenty more acronyms.
* Now, I'm an engineering manager, managing a team that does a lot of what I wrote about above!

### Everything Else
My wife and I enjoy hiking, biking, traveling, and playing with our Shih Tzu.
